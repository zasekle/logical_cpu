    //NOTE: This processor runs at ~54Hz. I was originally planning to attempt to simulate something
    // more complex with it. But even a processor from the early 90s will run at ~20MHz which is
    // something like 500,000x faster. So in order to make this processor able to do anything in
    // a reasonable amount of time, I would probably need to re-write the entire simulation with
    // dropping most of the logic gates themselves and this would defeat the purpose.

    //TODO
    // Right now the way that it loads the memory is actually part of the circuit, might want to change
    // that so it is programmatically done instead. There isn't actually any need to do it the way
    // I currently am.

    //TODO: I can probably tie my SignalGatekeeper to the set values of a lot of other places. For
    // example the RAM, the registers, the memory etc... Otherwise, it will need to propagate through
    // the entire thing every time.

    //TODO: With the way that I did run_circuit and grouping the gates before running them, it might
    // be possible to run them in a multithreaded way. Or maybe every time a signal splits I can
    // make a new thread (or a new task to pass into a thread pool at least). Or I could just make
    // multiple processors connected to the same RAM and executing different instructions lol.
    // Probably not the last one, while it would give me some insight into how to handle some of the
    // multi-threaded problems, it would also make the simulation run the propagation of electricity
    // on multiple CPUs.

    //Remember that when running stuff in the registers, there is always the possibility that
    // multiple clock ticks are needed. The first will do something like enable the `Set` bit. The
    // second will keep the `Set` bit high and change the input values. The third will bring the
    // `Set` bit low without changing the inputs.
